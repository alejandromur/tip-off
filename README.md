<h1>tip-off</h1>
<p> simple modal box writen with #CSS. No #JavaScript is required. No pretentions, just for fun</p>
<p>At the very bottom of the #HTML before body ends, there is the modal lightbox. This box is an &lt;a&gt; element that has nothing inside and it is not shown unless it matches your conditions.</p>
<p>Along projects and responsive, mobile first, content first, human first thoughts come into play I fight with some scenarios where the navigation on small devices is better for the users when they handle theirs devices in portrait mode. Here is were tip-off is very handy because it lets you to show a little message to the user and close it easily, with no Javascript, just with few lines of CSS.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>To see it in action just resize the browser to fit the height of the browser between 160px - 400px</p>

<h2>Advanced tip</h2>
<p>The power of this modal box is based in the pseudo element :target. However eventually the href attribute could broke your URL when the modal box is clicked. In those situations you must find a solution like this href="< ?php echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'].'#close'; ?>"</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>• Download or fork the repository.</p>
<p>• Include CSS file in your HTML.</p>
<p>• Customize or change the CSS files.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Please, take this <a href="http://www.mamutlove.es/projects/tip-off/" title="Demo" target="_blank">demo</a> as it is, a little demo where I pretend to show to you the power of this snippet, but consider your own target before copy/paste.</p>
